# About MyNostalgia directory

This directory is an archive of digital media that give me nostalgia. This collection includes images, audio, and video of various environments and technologies.

For me, I have nostalgia for many old systems, most notably systems that show good skeumorphism. I currently don't have any nostalgia for software that doesn't have skeumorphism or basic gradient, so most software from 2011-2014 and onward I am not sentimental for. I have been suffering heavily from the minimalism movement, and the drop in popularity for 3D design, and peoples support for computer graphics that have no effort put into them and can be made by a 3 year old in MS-PAINT 1.0 for Windows 1.0.

Examples of system media that doesn't give me nostalgia include:

Windows 8 and onward - Doesn't look good

iOS 7 and onward - Doesn't look good

OS X 10.10 and onward - Doesn't look good

GNOME 3 and onward - Doesn't look too good, but at least it has some basic gradients

KDE 5 and onward - Doesn't look too good, but at least it has some basic gradients

Android 5.0 and onward

Nintendo Wii U System Software and onward - Doesn't look too good

etc.
